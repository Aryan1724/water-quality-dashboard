# Water Quality Monitoring Project (Starter)

**Goal:** Track river/beach pollution (separate from STP inlets), validate metrics, and generate trends, seasonality, correlations, anomalies, segmentation, and a simple 2025 forecast preview.

## How to run
1. Open `water_quality_project_starter.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab.
2. Run cells **top to bottom**.
3. Outputs (tables/CSVs/plots) will be saved to `outputs/`.

## What's inside
- `data/` – your Excel and PDF report (copied here).
- `water_quality_project_starter.ipynb` – single notebook to do everything **without ML knowledge**.
- `outputs/` – figures and CSVs will appear here after running.
